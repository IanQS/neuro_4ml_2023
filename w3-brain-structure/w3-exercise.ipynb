    "# Neuro4ML - Week 3 - Brain structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we're going to analyse some real data, which come from larval zebrafish. \n",
    "\n",
    "Larval zebrafish are an increasingly used model in neuroscience for three main reasons:\n",
    "1. They develop rapidly ex utero, from a single cell to a free-swimming larva in just four days, meaning that their development can be easily studied.\n",
    "2. They display a variety of behaviours including a distinct locomotor repertoire, a diurnal pattern of activity and by three weeks of age, social preference.\n",
    "3. They have a vertebrate brain plan and at larval stages are small (~4mm body length) and translucent, enabling cellular-resolution whole-brain imaging in both fixed tissue and live animals. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we're going to look at the 3d morphology of ~4,000 neurons in the zebrafish brain. In brief these morphologies were obtained by: \n",
    "* Fluorescently labeling 1-2 neurons per animal.\n",
    "* Imaging each animal and tracing each neuron.\n",
    "* Aligning these images in 3d so that all neurons are in a common reference frame.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about the data in [Kunst et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.04.034) or on this [website](https://mapzebrain.org/home).  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are four parts to the exercise: loading the data, looking at the data, estimating a connectivity matrix and some open exploration. "
